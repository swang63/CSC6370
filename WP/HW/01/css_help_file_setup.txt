How to Connect a CSS External Style Sheet to HTML File


To link CSS to an HTML file, we use the <link> tag that you put in the HTML’s <head> section. The link will look like this:
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css" />
</head>
Conclusion
While there are many ways to link CSS to HTML, the best method to do it is to use the HTML’s <link> tag.
 By using this method, you’ll get to save time and code more efficiently without affecting your website’s visual representation
