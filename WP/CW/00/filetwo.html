    <p>Is this the real life?<br />Is this just fantasy?<br />Caught in a landslide<br />No escape from reality<br />Open your eyes<br />Look up to the skies and see<br />I&#39;m just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br />Because I&#39;m easy come, easy go<br />A little high, little low<br />Anyway the wind blows, doesn&#39;t really matter to me, to me</p>
<p>Mama, just killed a man<br />Put a gun against his head<br />Pulled my trigger, now he&#39;s dead<br />Mama, life had just begun<br />But now I&#39;ve gone and thrown it all away<br />Mama, ooh<br />Didn&#39;t mean to make you cry<br />If I&#39;m not back again this time tomorrow<br />Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters</p>
<p>Too late, my time has come<br />Sends shivers down my spine<br />Body&#39;s aching all the time<br />Goodbye everybody I&#39;ve got to go<br />Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br />Mama, ooh (anyway the wind blows)<br />I don&#39;t want to die<br />I sometimes wish I&#39;d never been born at all</p>

    <p>Welcome to section three</p>
<p>I see a little silhouetto of a man<br />Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango<br />Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me<br /> Gallileo, Gallileo<br />Gallileo, Gallileo<br />Gallileo Figaro, magnifico</p>
<p>I&#39;m just a poor boy and nobody loves me<br />He&#39;s just a poor boy from a poor family<br />Spare him his life from this monstrosity</p>
<p>Easy come easy go, will you let me go<br />Bismillah! No we will not let you go, let him go<br />Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go<br />Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go<br />Will not let you go, let me go (never)<br />Never, never, never, never, never let me go<br />No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br />Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go<br />Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me<br />For me<br />For me</p>
<p>So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye<br />So you think you can love me and leave me to die<br />Oh, baby, can&#39;t do this to me, baby<br />Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here</p>
<p>Ooh yeah, ooh yeah</p>
<p>Nothing really matters<br />Anyone can see<br />Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me</p>
<p>Anyway the wind blows<br />&nbsp;</p>
